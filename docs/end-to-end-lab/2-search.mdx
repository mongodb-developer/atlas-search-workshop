# 2. üîç $search

```
  $search!!!!
```

* Search Tester
  * `path: { wildcard: "*"}`: query every (that fits the type) indexed field
* Compass [optional]
* Atlas aggregation UI
  * "export to language" (`Node` in our case)

1. Navigate to the Search Tester for the `library.books` `default` Atlas Search index.

2. Search for "tao of pooh".

What does the Search Tester do behind the scenes?

<details>
<summary>Click "Edit $search Query"</summary>
<div>

```js
[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "default",
      text: {
        query: "tao of pooh",
        path: {
          wildcard: "*"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```
:::caution

Two things about this query:
* The `text` operator will *OR* all of the analyzed `query` terms. _tao OR of OR pooh_
* `path: {wildcard: "*"}` searches against every type matching indexed field.

So this is a pretty heavy query, in terms of broadcasting query terms across your entire corpus. Heavy doesn't necessarily
mean _slow_ as this query will complete in a split fraction of a second, though generally we want to craft queries in 
a more nuanced, domain and user aware, fashion to improve both precision and recall, leveraging innate relevancy ranking,
and fine-tuned scoring controls. For example, in this case we probably don't really want to match documents that match only
because they have the word "of" indexed in any textual field. Interestingly, the best book for our query does appear first
even with a broadcast, catch-all sort of query. Relevancy for the win here, as documents rank higher when more of the
query terms match. So even with broad queries, relevancy ranking still can do a decent job.

3. Let's go ahead take the next step towards wrangling `$search` queries, by using an aggregation pipeline tool, such as
the Atlas collections aggregation. Copy the `$search` aggregation pipeline behind the scenes of the Search Tester and
navigate to the Atlas library.books collection's "Aggregation" tab, pasting it into the "TEXT" area.

While you're here, edit the query to only search by phrase, not just loose OR'd terms, on only the `title` field.

<details>
<summary>`phrase` search on `title` field</summary>
<div>

```js

[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "default",
      phrase: {
        query: "tao of pooh",
        path: ["title"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

:::tip

The `phrase` operator first analyzes the `query` text into individual terms, then constructs a query that matches these
terms in consecutive, or close (see _slop_ factor), order. In this case, we match those three consecutive words, "tao of pooh",
in the `title` field. Note how the results are in pretty decent relevancy order (by title).

4. "Export to Language" copy the code for your current aggregation pipeline.  You'll use this code in the next section.

<details>
<summary>export to code: Node</summary>
<div>

```js
[
  {
    '$search': {
      'index': 'default', 
      'phrase': {
        'query': 'tao of pooh', 
        'path': [
          'title'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```
</div>
