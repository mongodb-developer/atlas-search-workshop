# 3. ðŸ’» Code

Now is the moment of truth, where `$search` integrates into our book application, and becomes truly *usable*. Having a
working application that we can iterate on is the best way to proceed with our Atlas Search learning journey. It's your
data. It's your app. It's your `$search` pipeline. When it's all working we feel confident and can now safely make changes
and see the effect of those changes through the experiences of our users.

Just like in the previous two sections, let's go, 1..., 2..., 3!

1. Implement `/books/search?q=<query>` search service

Paste code into the search service stub, parameterizing the `query`.

<details>
<summary>Service endpoint implementation</summary>
<div>

`server/src/controllers/books.ts#searchBooks`:

```js
    public async searchBooks(query: string, limit: number = 10, skip: number = 0): Promise<Book[]> {
        if (limit > 100) limit = 100;

        const searchPipeline = [
            {
                '$search': {
                  'index': 'default', 
                  'phrase': {
                    'query': query, 
                    'path': [
                      'title'
                    ]
                  }
                }
              },
            { $skip: skip },
            { $limit: limit }
        ];

        const booksAgg = collections?.books?.aggregate<Book>(searchPipeline);
        const books = await booksAgg.toArray();
        return books;   
    }
```
</div>
</details>

## 2. Service end-point in action

Got JSON? [http://localhost:5000/books/search?q=tao](http://localhost:5000/books/search?q=tao)

3. Search UI

Seeing ideally *relevant* book covers, as we type, is a nice way to experience the benefits of Atlas Search. With this
straightforward baseline, using the defaults, we now have a multitude of ways to adjust 

<img
    alt="End result of $search integration into our book app"
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/end-to-end-lab/app-search-ui.png')}
/>

âœ… Search as you type in the [Books Catalogue](http://localhost:4200/catalogue) works?
