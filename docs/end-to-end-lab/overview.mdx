# ↕️ End to End Lab Overview

Let's get real. By real, we mean specifically here that we are going to make search *work*, end-to-end, from 
enabling search on the books collection, to having a nicely working end-user search experience in our application.
There's a lot of machinations and flexibilities happening behind the scenes, but we can easily get search working 
well with the easy path default settings, and tune as needed from there.  Enough talk; it's your turn. Work
through the next three sections, and give a 👍 when you've got the app search UI functioning like this:

<img
    alt="End result of $search integration into our book app"
    src={useBaseUrl('/img/end-to-end-lab/app-search-ui.png')}
/>

Lab Goals, by section:
1. ☑️ Atlas Search Tester
2. ☑️ $search aggregation pipeline (using Atlas UI or Compass)
