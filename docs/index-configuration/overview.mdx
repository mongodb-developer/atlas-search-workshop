# Index Configuration Overview

Let's take a moment to reflect the progress of search integration into our book application. Within the last 30 minutes or so,
you've:

* created a cloud-based database
* ingested a database of several collections of initial data
* enabled dynamically mapped full-text search on the books collection
* in turn, a tightly integrated, in sync, triple-replicated Lucene-based, search service deployed, 
  awaiting our `$search` requests
* run the Search Tester
* and manually adjusted and run a `$search` aggregation pipeline
* ... for free*. 

Applause! What a world we live in where this kind of reliably managed, powerful search on our own data comes as easily
as a few wizard clicks.

:::note
Lab Goals:
* Make various English word stems searchable
:::

1. First try this aggregation pipeline:

```
[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "books",
      phrase: {
        query: "spaced searches",
        path: "title"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      title: 1,
      score: {
        $meta: "searchScore"
      },
      scoreDetails: {
        $meta: "searchScoreDetails"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

2. Try "space search" instead, for the `query`.  What's the difference and why?

Let's build a new index with some additional analyzers defined, and while we're going to be
building a fresh index, we'll go ahead and define some facet fields as well so we don't need to rebuild
an index in the Facting lab too.

3. Create new index on `library.books` named `books` (the initial index created is named `default`),
   using this JSON mapping definition

```
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true,
    "fields": {
      "genres": [
        {
          "type": "stringFacet"
        },
        {
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "title": {
        "multi": {
          "english": {
            "analyzer": "lucene.english",
            "type": "string"
          },
          "phonetic": {
            "analyzer": "phonetic",
            "type": "string"
          },
          "shingles": {
            "analyzer": "standard.shingles",
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "type": "string"
      },
      "year": [
        {
          "type": "numberFacet"
        },
        {
          "type": "number"
        },
        {
          "type": "stringFacet"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "analyzers": [
    {
      "charFilters": [],
      "name": "standard.shingles",
      "tokenFilters": [
        {
          "type": "lowercase"
        },
        {
          "maxShingleSize": 3,
          "minShingleSize": 2,
          "type": "shingle"
        }
      ],
      "tokenizer": {
        "type": "standard"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "phonetic",
      "tokenFilters": [
        {
          "originalTokens": "include",
          "type": "daitchMokotoffSoundex"
        }
      ],
      "tokenizer": {
        "type": "standard"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

4. When that index is active, try this search now:

```
  {
    $search: {
      index: "books",
      text: {
        query: "spaced searches",
        path: {
          multi: "english",
          value: "title"
        }
      }
      scoreDetails: true
    }
  }
```
Notice how we now can search `title` using the default `lucene.standard` analyzer, or specify the `english` analyzed version.
We could have made the default analyzer `lucene.english` for all dynamic fields where no "multi" path is needed at query
time. Having fields analyzed multiple ways is a useful technique for better tuned relevancy or more flexible findability.

:::tip
`path` can be an array of path specifications, either concrete field names, wildcard, or "multi" variants.

âœ… Were you successful in finding "Space Search" from the "spaced searches" query?

# Discussion

Let's talk about inverted indexes and how Atlas Search maps your Atlas documents to the underlying Lucene index...

:::tip
Did you notice that `phonetic` filter we snuck in there?  What can you do with that?

```
  compound: {
    should: [
      {
        phrase: {
          query: "dao of pooh",
          path: {"value": "title","multi":"phonetic"},
        },
      },
    ],
  }
```
