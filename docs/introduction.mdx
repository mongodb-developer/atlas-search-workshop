## Full Text Search

So far, we have an application, but the search capabilities are quite limited.

Now that you know about MongoDB's query language and aggregation pipelines framework,
it's time to explore Atlas Search, a fully managed search service that's built on top
of MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework.

## What is Atlas Search?

Atlas Search integrates with the other Atlas services to provide you with a fully managed search service.
It leverages [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org), the leading open-source search engine library.
It's also integrated into MongoDB's aggregation framework, which means that you can use that same query
language to powerfully search your data.

## Benefits of Atlas Search

Atlas Search provides you with several benefits:
* **Full-text search** - full-text search capabilities, including synonyms and various fuzzier
  options including ngrams and phonetic matching
* **Language support** - A wide range of language-specific support, built-in
* **Scoring** - Top-notch relevancy ranked results, with fine-tunable control of scoring parameters
* **Faceting** - Counts by buckets, within search result context
* **Vector Search** - Documents, represented in N-dimensional space; findable within linear or angular distance proximity
* **Query Analytics** - Actionable insights from analyzing search query activity
* **Additional/Advanced Topics** - highlighting, query terms within context; geospatial proximity, autocomplete, `.explain()`
