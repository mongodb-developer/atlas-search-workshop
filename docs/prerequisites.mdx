# ðŸŒ… Prerequisites 

## Developer Day attendees

Your environment should be all set at this point to start the Atlas Search Workshop.  Here's where things should be:

* Atlas account and environment alive and well.
* library collections imported
* That's it

## Atlas Search Workshop Only

If you're jumping in fresh here, have these set up before proceeding with this Atlas Search Workshop:

1. Create and sign in to your Atlas account - a free account works fine
2. Copy the connection string from within Atlas...
3. Import the `library` collections using the [library data Import Tool](https://mdb.link/import-library-data)
