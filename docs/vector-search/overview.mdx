# Vector Lab Overview

Lab Goals:
* Understand vector search concepts, configuration, and usage
* Explore 2-dimensional vectors

# â†— Vector Search

1. Create a new collection, called `vectors` (it's fine to put this in your copy of the `library` database alongside `books`),
   and populate it with the following data:

```js
[
  {
    "doc_num": 1,
    "v": [0.17,0.32]
  },
  {
    "doc_num": 2,
    "v": [-0.49,0.69]
  },
  {
    "doc_num": 3,
    "v": [0.95,0.88]
  }
]
```

2. Create an Atlas Search index for the `vectors` collection, leave its name as `default`.
   Use this JSON index configuration.

<details>
<summary>knnVector index configuration</summary>
<div>

```js
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true,
    "fields": {
      "v": [
        {
          "dimensions": 2,
          "similarity": "euclidean",
          "type": "knnVector"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</div>
</details>

3. After this new index is saved and Active, search it for documents near a query vector:

<details>
<summary>$search for nearest neighbors</summary>
<div>

```js
[
  {
    $search: {
      index: "default",
      knnBeta: {
        vector: [0.5, 0.5],
        path: "v",
        k: 2,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    "$project": {
      "score": { $meta: "searchScore" }
    }
  }
]
```

</div>
</details>
